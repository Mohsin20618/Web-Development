        <h1>Vaccination begins</h1>

        <p> <strong>
                <br>
                THE next phase in Pakistan’s fightback against the novel coronavirus has begun with appropriate fanfare.
                On
                Tuesday at the PM Office, in the presence of Prime Minister Imran Khan, anaesthetist and critical care
                specialist Prof Rana Imran Sikander became the first person in the country to be vaccinated against the
                disease. </strong></p>

        <p> The first batch of Covid-19 vaccines, totalling half a million doses manufactured by Sinopharm, had arrived
            in Islamabad from Beijing on Monday, and the federal government dispatched the provinces their share from it
            the next day. Inoculation drives on a provincial level began yesterday. The National Command and Operation
            Centre deserves plaudits for the smooth start to the mammoth countrywide campaign. Judging by the detailed
            plan it has drawn up, considerable effort is being expended to ensure that vaccine procurement keeps up with
            the pace of inoculation, and a report in this paper yesterday quoted SAPM on Health Dr Faisal Sultan as
            saying he does not believe the supply side will pose a problem. <br><br>
            “We are more concerned about the demand side,” he said. The fear is that of the 70m of the adult population
            who should be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, as per health experts’ view, a considerable number — up
            to 30m — may refuse it or opt out for one reason or another. <br>
            That is among several concerns in a situation where, at least to some extent, the authorities are flying
            blind. The novel coronavirus has been around for a little over a year. It is only recently that health
            professionals have got a handle on managing severe cases of Covid-19 to a certain extent, while the
            long-term and sometimes devastating implications of the disease are still being observed and understood.
            <br><br>
            The immune system’s response to the vaccines, despite extensive human trials leading up to the approval
            stage, remains the subject of some debate. Consider that health authorities in France and Sweden have
            cleared AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine but advised against administering it to people over 65 years; that is
            at variance with the EU’s decision to approve the vaccine for adults of all ages. Meanwhile, a major UK
            study has confirmed that most people who have been infected with the coronavirus have antibodies in their
            blood for at least six months. Earlier, the consensus on viral immune response had considered three months
            as a minimum period during which one was highly unlikely to be reinfected. <br><br>
            One hopes that the government’s timeline regarding the procurement of the remaining batches of the vaccines
            is a realistic one. In the meantime it must prepare the Pakistani public about possible side effects of
            inoculation so that misinformation does not discourage people from registering. Further, regular updates
            with disaggregated data about those being inoculated will go a long way towards countering inevitable
            rumours about ‘elite’ individuals jumping the queue. Instilling trust in the transparency of the process is
            critical.
